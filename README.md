# Final Project
## Surface Crack Detection Dataset
In this project, we study a dataset containing images of various concrete surfaces with and 
without crack. The images are divided into two classes as negative (without crack) and positive 
(with crack). There are in total 32137 images for training with 227 x 227 pixels with RGB 
channels (16070 images in the positive class and 16037 images in the negative class) 
Visual  crack  inspection  and  detection  plays  a  major  role  in  building  inspection  and  is  a  widely 
used method for determining the building health. The goal is to build a model to detect a crack for 
the test set. For each image in the test set, you must predict whether or not there is a crack (Positive 
or Negative) and submit your results on Blackboard by 11:39 PM on Friday 12/17. You need to 
submit a csv file with two columns: image_id and set and predicted_class. 
Accuracy Metric: Accuracy will be used to evaluate the model performance.
